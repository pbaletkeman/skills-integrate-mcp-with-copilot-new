## Agent Mode & MCP Server Usage

This project supports advanced AI-powered workflows using GitHub Copilot's Agent Mode and the Model Context Protocol (MCP) server.

### How to Enable Agent Mode and MCP Tools

1. **Open Copilot Chat panel** in VS Code and select **Agent** mode.
2. Ensure the MCP server is configured in `.vscode/mcp.json` (see previous setup instructions).
3. Use natural language prompts to triage issues, research enhancements, and automate tasks. Example prompts:
    - "Search for any other repositories for organizing extra curricular activities."
    - "Please look at the code for the 3rd option and give me a detailed description of the features."
    - "How many open issues are there on my repository?"
    - "Please get the list of issues, review the descriptions and comments, and pick the top 3 most important."
4. When prompted, authorize Copilot to use MCP tools for issue management and research.

### Tips
- You can proactively grant tool permissions for the session to streamline workflow.
- Use the Copilot Chat panel to review suggestions and provide feedback to narrow results.
- Once issues are triaged, ask Copilot to implement or update them directly from chat.
